Working with Optimizely X? Check out the [Optimizely X CLI](https://github.com/teamroboboogie/x-optimizely-cli) from @teamroboboogie!

Optimizely-CLI (optcli) is a command line tool that lets developers build experiments faster by using the sofware tools you already love and publish to Optimizely when ready. We build a lot of tests at [FunnelEnvy](http://www.funnelenvy.com) and found that (being stubborn engineers) we were more comfortable using our source editors and Git to develop locally - and this had a *significant* positive impact on our test velocity.

Optimizely-cli includes a command line executable that also integrates with either the[Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) (Google Chrome) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox) extensions for local development / preview and the Optimizely API for publishing tests.

Brief intro below - for more usage details check out our [Optimizely-CLI page](http://www.funnelenvy.com/optimizely-cli/).
